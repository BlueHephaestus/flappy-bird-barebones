###This is an extremely barebones [Flappy Bird](http://flappybird.io/) clone, made for AIs using NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies), or other Genetic Algorithms. A good example of one of these algorithms in action can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44). 

###I made the physics and settings so that I could barely play it, then I increased the speed to maximum. Hopefully, this will allow a bot to learn how to play it faster, instead of having to spend a large portion of time waiting for the pace of the game.

###Feel free to tinker with any of the config settings at the top of the file, good luck, and have fun!
